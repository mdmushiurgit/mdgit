      Bangladesh (/ˌbæŋɡləˈdɛʃ, ˌbɑːŋ-/;[15] Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced
      [ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ] (listen)), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is
      a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most-populous country in the
      world, with a population of around 169 million people in an area of
      148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi).[10] Bangladesh is among the most
      densely populated countries in the world, and shares land borders with
      India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast; to the
      south it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated
      from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by the
      Indian state of Sikkim in the north. Dhaka, the capital and largest city,
      is the nation's political, financial and cultural centre. Chittagong, the
      second-largest city, is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal.
